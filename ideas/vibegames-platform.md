# vibegames.com collaborative game platform

Imagine a website where anyone can build a game and push it to a repository to be automatically rendered on vibegames.com. Users can:

- Create and submit free games in a shared repo.
- Play and rate games directly on the site.
- See games ranked by community ratings.

This open platform encourages creativity and sharing of small games.
