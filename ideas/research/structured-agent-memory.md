# Structured Agent Memory

Investigate whether GPT-5 can perform agent workloads more effectively by using structured memory stored in git and Markdown, rather than relying solely on a standard agent loop.

- Store agent state and context in version-controlled Markdown files.
- Compare performance, reliability, and flexibility against a conventional loop.
- Evaluate benefits for collaboration and reproducibility.
- Explore tooling to automate memory management and retrieval.
