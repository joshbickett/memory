# Opportunity Cost

Opportunity cost is the value of the best alternative you give up when making a choice. A rich memory system presents many appealing ideas, but selecting one path means setting others aside. Reflecting on these trade-offs helps decide where to invest attention and effort.

Remember: you can't pursue every good idea at once, so weigh the benefits to choose wisely.
